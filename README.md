# Peak Late Join

Allow late joining of a game. Catch up to your friends!

## Features
- Join an ongoing game in progress
- Automatically catch up to the current game state
- No RAGDOLLING on spawn

## Warning
There are mods that are incompatible with this mod, such as mods that modify player spawning or game state in a way that conflicts with late joining. Please ensure you test thoroughly if you are using other mods alongside this one.

## Note
If you are gonna be warping or reviving a scout make sure to:
- Revive them one by one (to prevent desyncs and large packets being sent at once); this also prevents Proton errors
- Wait a few seconds between each revive/warp
- Reset RigidBody on the scout after reviving/warping them
- Check for previous Room State before reviving/warping a scout
